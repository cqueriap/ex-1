DNA to mRNA

I have provided two .java files and two .txt files. The .txt files contain test rna strings and the resulting
amino acid sequences. The file named shortRNA.txt contains a short rna sequence that is
easy to verify by hand. And the other .txt file contains a very long rna sequence. The
EncodeProtein.java file contains two methods.

The translate method returns a String that represents the amino acid chain
formed from an RNA string. The TestEncodeProtein.java file will run the two test cases and output whether I have runtime errors, whether my answer is correct for each test case, or whether my answer is incorrect for each
test case.
